# Ad-Manager

The project is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to streamline the management of advertisements within a secure, role-based access environment. This application serves as a comprehensive platform for businesses or individuals looking to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) advertisements while ensuring only authorized users have appropriate permissions for each type of action.

 Key Features:
1. Advertisement Management: Users can create new ads, browse existing ones, update ad content or status, and delete ads as necessary. The platform ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for handling ad-related operations.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The application implements an RBAC system, which assigns different roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) to users. This ensures that only users with the correct privileges can perform specific actions. For instance, while an admin might have full CRUD access, an editor might only be able to create and update, and a viewer may only read.
3. Secure Authentication and Authorization: The application integrates robust security measures using Spring Security, including JWT or OAuth2 protocols, to protect user data and validate permissions during each interaction with the system.
4. Service-Oriented Architecture: Built using Spring Boot, the application takes advantage of modular components, allowing for easy scaling and integration with other microservices if needed.
5. Customizable Ad Content: Advertisements can be tailored with various types of content, formats, and metadata to suit different user needs or business models.
6. Logging and Audit Trail: To maintain accountability and transparency, the application includes detailed logging and audit capabilities, keeping a record of user actions and changes to advertisements.

Use Cases:
- Ad Management for Online Marketplaces: Provides a platform for listing products or services with role-based controls for sellers, moderators, and buyers.
- Content Publishing Platforms: Enables editors and publishers to collaboratively manage advertisement content while maintaining oversight through role assignments.
- Corporate Advertising Portals: Supports internal or partner-driven advertising campaigns, ensuring that only designated personnel can modify or publish ads.

This application is designed with scalability, security, and ease of use in mind, making it a versatile solution for any environment where advertisement management is a critical function.
